# Majordomo broker

This is an example broker implementation that partially implements
[7/MDP](https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:7/MDP/). Notably, the broker and workers do
not send or listen to heartbeats.

## Running this example

To run this example, install the example project dependencies and run the
majordomo example script with `pnpm`:

```
> pnpm install
> pnpm run majordomo
```

## Expected behaviour

The example will start a broker and some workers, then do some requests. The
output will be similar to this:

```
starting broker on tcp://127.0.0.1:5555
starting broker on tcp://127.0.0.1:5555
starting worker soda on tcp://127.0.0.1:5555
starting worker tea on tcp://127.0.0.1:5555
starting worker coffee on tcp://127.0.0.1:5555
starting worker tea on tcp://127.0.0.1:5555
