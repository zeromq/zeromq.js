   * queued successfully.
   *
   * ```typescript
   * await socket.send("hello world")
   * await socket.send(["hello", "world"])
   * ```
   *
   * Queueing may fail eventually if the socket has been configured with a
   * {@link sendTimeout}.
   *
   * A call to {@link send}() is guaranteed to return with a resolved promise
   * immediately if the message could be queued directly.
   *
   * Only **one** asynchronously blocking call to {@link send}() may be executed
   * simultaneously. If you call {@link send}() again on a socket that is in the
   * mute state it will return a rejected promise with an `EBUSY` error.
   *
   * The reason for disallowing multiple {@link send}() calls simultaneously is
   * that it could create an implicit queue of unsendable outgoing messages.
   * This would circumvent the socket's {@link sendHighWaterMark}. Such an
   * implementation could even exhaust all system memory and cause the Node.js
   * process to abort.
   *
   * For most application you should not notice this implementation detail. Only
   * in rare occasions will a call to {@link send}() that does not resolve
   * immediately be undesired. Here are some common scenarios:
   *
   * * If you wish to **send a message**, use `await send(...)`. ZeroMQ socket
   *   types have been carefully designed to give you the correct blocking
   *   behaviour on the chosen socket type in almost all cases:
   *
   *   * If sending is not possible, it is often better to wait than to continue
   *     as if nothing happened. For example, on a {@link Request} socket, you
   *     can only receive a reply once a message has been sent; so waiting until
   *     a message could be queued before continuing with the rest of the
   *     program (likely to read from the socket) is required.
   *
   *   * Certain socket types (such as {@link Router}) will always allow
   *     queueing messages and `await send(...)` won't delay any code that comes
   *     after. This makes sense for routers, since typically you don't want a
   *     single send operation to stop the handling of other incoming or
   *     outgoing messages.
   *
   * * If you wish to send on an occasionally **blocking** socket (for example
   *   on a {@link Router} with the {@link Router.mandatory} option set, or on a
   *   {@link Dealer}) and you're 100% certain that **dropping a message is
   *   better than blocking**, then you can set the {@link sendTimeout} option
   *   to `0` to effectively force {@link send}() to always resolve immediately.
   *   Be prepared to catch exceptions if sending a message is not immediately
   *   possible.
   *
   * * If you wish to send on a socket and **messages should be queued before
   *   they are dropped**, you should implement a [simple
   *   queue](../examples/queue/queue.ts) in JavaScript. Such a queue is not
   *   provided by this library because most real world applications need to
   *   deal with undeliverable messages in more complex ways - for example, they
   *   might need to reply with a status message; or first retry delivery a
   *   certain number of times before giving up.
   *
   * @param message Single message or multipart message to queue for sending.
   * @param options Any options, if applicable to the socket type (DRAFT only).
   * @returns Resolved when the message was successfully queued.
