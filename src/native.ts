 * Events always have a `type` property with an {@link EventType} value.
 *
 * The following socket events can be generated. This list may be different
 * depending on the ZeroMQ version that is used.
 *
 * Note that the **error** event is avoided by design, since this has a [special
 * behaviour](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_error_events) in Node.js
 * causing an exception to be thrown if it is unhandled.
 *
 * Other error names are adjusted to be as close to possible as other
 * [networking related](https://nodejs.org/api/net.html) event names in Node.js
 * and/or to the corresponding ZeroMQ.js method call. Events (including any
 * errors) that correspond to a specific operation are namespaced with a colon
 * `:`, e.g. `bind:error` or `connect:retry`.
 *
 * * **accept** - ZMQ_EVENT_ACCEPTED The socket has accepted a connection from a
 *   remote peer.
 *
 * * **accept:error** - ZMQ_EVENT_ACCEPT_FAILED The socket has rejected a
 *   connection from a remote peer.
 *
 *   The following additional details will be included with this event:
 *
 *   * `error` - An error object that describes the specific error
 *     that occurred.
 *
 * * **bind** - ZMQ_EVENT_LISTENING The socket was successfully bound to a
 *   network interface.
 *
 * * **bind:error** - ZMQ_EVENT_BIND_FAILED The socket could not bind to a given
 *   interface.
 *
 *   The following additional details will be included with this event:
 *
 *   * `error` - An error object that describes the specific error
 *     that occurred.
 *
 * * **connect** - ZMQ_EVENT_CONNECTED The socket has successfully connected to
 *   a remote peer.
 *
 * * **connect:delay** - ZMQ_EVENT_CONNECT_DELAYED A connect request on the
 *   socket is pending.
 *
 * * **connect:retry** - ZMQ_EVENT_CONNECT_RETRIED A connection attempt is being
 *   handled by reconnect timer. Note that the reconnect interval is
 *   recalculated at each retry.
 *
 *   The following additional details will be included with this event:
 *
 *   * `interval` - The current reconnect interval.
 *
 * * **close** - ZMQ_EVENT_CLOSED The socket was closed.
 *
 * * **close:error** - ZMQ_EVENT_CLOSE_FAILED The socket close failed. Note that
 *   this event occurs **only on IPC** transports..
 *
 *   The following additional details will be included with this event:
 *
 *   * `error` - An error object that describes the specific error
 *     that occurred.
 *
 * * **disconnect** - ZMQ_EVENT_DISCONNECTED The socket was disconnected
 *   unexpectedly.
 *
 * * **handshake** - ZMQ_EVENT_HANDSHAKE_SUCCEEDED The ZMTP security mechanism
 *   handshake succeeded. NOTE: This event may still be in DRAFT statea and not
 *   yet available in stable releases.
 *
 * * **handshake:error:protocol** - ZMQ_EVENT_HANDSHAKE_FAILED_PROTOCOL The ZMTP
 *   security mechanism handshake failed due to some mechanism protocol error,
 *   either between the ZMTP mechanism peers, or between the mechanism server
 *   and the ZAP handler. This indicates a configuration or implementation error
 *   in either peer resp. the ZAP handler. NOTE: This event may still be in
 *   DRAFT state and not yet available in stable releases.
 *
 * * **handshake:error:auth** - ZMQ_EVENT_HANDSHAKE_FAILED_AUTH The ZMTP
 *   security mechanism handshake failed due to an authentication failure. NOTE:
 *   This event may still be in DRAFT state and not yet available in stable
 *   releases.
 *
 * * **handshake:error:other** - ZMQ_EVENT_HANDSHAKE_FAILED_NO_DETAIL
 *   Unspecified error during handshake. NOTE: This event may still be in DRAFT
 *   state and not yet available in stable releases.
 *
 * * **end** - ZMQ_EVENT_MONITOR_STOPPED Monitoring on this socket ended.

 *   not interpret. Please submit a pull request for new event types if they are
